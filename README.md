# Address-Book
Author - Aswanth Mahesh<br>
This is my first project in C.<br>
The Address Book helps users store and manage contact details. It supports features like adding, searching, editing, deleting, saving, and listing contacts. Data is persisted in a file for later retrieval. Array of structures, pointers, strings, file handling etc are the concepts used in this project.
